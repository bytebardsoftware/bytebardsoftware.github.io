Look. We know Bazel is hard, and often frustrating.
That's why we'd love to help you with it!

Whether it's a big, hands-on-keyboards migration, help for making the case up or down the leadership chain, or just a short chat, we'd be happy to do everything in our power to get un-stuck.

There are two ways for you to get in touch with us.

Firstly, you can email us at **contact@bytebard.software**.

Or you can fill out the enquiry form below.

We work internationally, but our best timezones are in EMEA.

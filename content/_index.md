# We help engineering organizations fix and maintain their Bazel builds

With tenures at Apple, Twitter, Gradle, and more, we've spent most of our careers dealing with massive builds for massive teams at massive companies.
And we got pretty good at it!

We know how to ship build infrastructure that delights your engineers, enabling them to ship better code, faster.


## Okay, but what can you _actually_ help with?

We have years of experience in the occult arts of Bazelmancy, especially at big organizations. 
As a result, we can help you with the trickiest bits of Bazel such as:

### Bazel Migrations

Bazel migrations are scary. It's usually a big decision, that you have to commit to up-front, that your engineers may or may not be happy with.
How do you fit the quirks of your code into Bazel? How do you make sure that, once you switch, the code you deploy is correct? 
How do you make sure engineers can stay productive during and after the transition?

It can (and often does) get messy.

We've done this before. We have years of experience with Bazel migrations. We've seen the most common blockers (technical or otherwise), and we've gotten past them.

If you're currently planning a migration and want to make the case to your leadership, we have experience with that too!

### Ruleset Development

You need to wrap your internal CLI in Bazel. One of the open source rulesets _mostly_ works for your needs, but you need that extra feature to work with your internal library.

Whatever it is, you need Bazel to do more than it's currently doing, but don't really want to spend the 1000 hours it takes to get a degree from "Bazel University". 

Well, we have those. We've written far more Starlark than is probably healthy, and would love to bring that expertise to your code.

### That One Last Problem

You know the one. The hacky bit. That last 5% of a migration or a project that is not as "Bazel-y" as you thought it should be.

A rogue toolchain. A binary that just won't compile correctly.
That one dependency that insists it needs _this version_ of OpenSSL.

We've got years of experience walking this last, painful 5% and integrating it into Bazel, the right way.

## Our Mission

We believe building world-class software quickly should be much more **common**, and much more **joyful**.
We also believe that doing the small things right is the key to achieving that outcome.

A 10% improvement in one developer's output means tens of thousands of dollars a year in saved expenses. A 10% increase in their joy is even better, because engaged teams produce much higher-quality results (and are happier, which is a win-win). Scale that to a large organization, compounded over time, and a 10% improvement is easily worth seven figures.

Here's the thing. 10% improvements in tooling and processes are not only common, but blindingly obvious if you know where to look.
Teams usually know what the rough edges are around their development experience.

Sanding them off is not only worth it, but often the best decision one can do for the business. Hence, our mission:

> We cure papercuts at scale.

Have papercuts that you'd like cured? Parts of your developer experience that could be better but you just don't have the time to get a degree from the University of Bazel?

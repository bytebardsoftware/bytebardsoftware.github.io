# We help engineering organizations fix and maintain their Bazel builds

With tenures at Apple, Twitter, Gradle, and more, we've spent most of our careers dealing with massive builds for massive teams at massive companies.
And we got pretty good at it!

We know how to ship build infrastructure that delights your engineers, enabling them to ship better code, faster.


## Okay, but what can you _actually_ help with?

We have years of experience in the occult arts of Bazelmancy, especially at big organizations. 
As a result, we can help you with the trickiest bits of Bazel such as:

### Bazel Migrations

Bazel migrations are scary. It's usually a trapdoor decision, that you have to commit to up-front, that your engineers may or may not be happy with.
How do you fit the quirks of your code into Bazel? How do you make sure that what you build is correct once you switch? 
How do you make sure engineers can stay productive during and after the transition?

It can (and often does) get messy.

We've done this before. We have years of experience with Bazel migrations. We've seen the most common blockers (technical or otherwise), and we've gotten past them.

If you're currently planning a migration and want to make the case to your leadership, we have experience with that too!

### Ruleset Development

You need to wrap your internal CLI in Bazel. One of the open source rulesets _mostly_ works for your needs, but you need that extra feature to work with your internal library.

Whatever it is, you need Bazel to do more than it's currently doing, but don't really want to spend the 1000 hours it takes to get a degree from "Bazel University". 

Well, we have those. We've written far more Starlark than is probably healthy, and would love to bring that expertise to your code.

### That One Last Problem

You know the one. The hacky bit. That last 5% of a migration or a project that is not as "Bazel-y" as you thought it should be.

A rogue toolchain. A binary that just won't compile correctly.
That one dependency that insists it needs _this version_ of OpenSSL.

We've got years of experience walking this last, painful 5% and integrating it into Bazel, the right way.

Hi! I'm Borja.

# I Help Development Teams Build Rock-Solid Processes to Ship More, Faster

I'm obsessed with Developer Productivity and build systems. I want to help you and your team build the tools and processes it needs to ship more, faster, and with more joy.

After building tools for thousands of engineers at companies like Apple, Twitter, and Gradle, I'm now open to consulting engagements to bring those technologies to your company. 

I specialize in build systems for large repositories, most recently Bazel.

I've worked at some of the world's largest organizations, helping them adopt Bazel by building tools to make the experience seamless.

While most of my work is shut behind closed doors, I have also done substantial Open Source work. I've been maintainer for both the [Bazel IntelliJ Plugin](https://github.com/bazelbuild/intellij/pulls?q=author%3Ablorente) and the [Pants Build System](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pants/pulls?q=author%3Ablorente).


### Public Speaking

I have appeared in both BazelCon talks and Aspect Insights, Aspect's Bazel podcast:

## My Mission

I believe building world-class software quickly should be much more **common**, and much more **joyful**. I also believe that doing the small things right is the key to achieving that outcome.

A 10% improvement in one developer's output means tens of thousands of dollars a year in saved expenses. A 10% increase in their joy is even better, because engaged teams produce much higher-quality results (and are happier, which is a win-win). Scale that to a large organization, compounded over time, and a 10% improvement is easily worth seven figures.

Here's the thing. 10% improvements in tooling and processes are not only common, but blindingly obvious if you know where to look. Teams usually know what the rough edges are around their development experience.

Sanding them off is not only worth it, but often the best decision one can do for the business. Hence, my mission:

> I cure papercuts at scale.

Have papercuts that you'd like cured? Parts of your developer experience that could be better but you just don't have the time to get a degree from the University of Bazel?

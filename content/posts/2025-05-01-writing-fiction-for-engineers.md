On a conversation with Ludic (link), we got talking about writing fiction. Turns out, if you look at it through a very warped and narrow lense, writing fiction surprisingly resembles the act of software engineering.

Well, since I do look at the world through that narrow lense, and a lot of my friends do as well, let's explore the thundering mountains of fiction writing.

- You know the goal (write a book, a program that does X), but you can't foresee the path to get there.
- Scene planning as test driven development.
- Code without fear, you can always refactor.
